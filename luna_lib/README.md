A library housing various helpful utilities, created for the Luna project: https://github.com/AndreasTar/Luna

Expect breaking changes in each update!

Currently, SemVer system for this library is as follows:
For the entirety of the library, a single SemVer value is available. Major version increases when the library is in a state that
contains the modules that make it 'feel' like a complete version
Minor version defines the amount of modules that are complete and functional. This does not mean that they will never receive updates, if any,
but their current state is sufficient for their purposes.
Patch version is split among all modules and is incremented every time there is an update, however small or large.

For the purposes of clarity, each module additionally has a public `VERSION` variable, defining the SemVer version of the specific module.
This follows the normal SemVer rules. A module can be in major version 1 or more, but the entirety of the library may still be in major version 0, and vice-versa.
